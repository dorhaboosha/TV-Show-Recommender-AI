# TV Show Recommender AI
I created a **Python** program called "ShowSuggesterAI" that provides personalized TV show recommendations based on user input.
The program utilized **embeddings and vectors** to represent TV show descriptions and calculate similarities.
**Fuzzy string matching** was used to match user input with existing TV show names, employing libraries like thefuzz.
**OpenAI's API** was integrated for generating TV show ads and images using **DALL-E**.
**Pickle** was used to save and load embeddings.
The project was developed following **Test Driven Development (TDD)** to ensure functionality and quality.
